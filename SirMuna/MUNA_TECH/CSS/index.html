        <div class="orange">
            <h3>ORANGE</h3>
            <p>The complementary color of orange is azure. Orange pigments are largely in the ochre or cadmium families, and absorb mostly blue light</p>

            <h3>INDIGO</h3>
            <p>The primary colors that combine to make indigo are red and blue. To make indigo, blue must be the dominant pigment in the equation. The exact equation to produce indigo is to mix one-third red and two-thirds blue.19 Aug 2022

        <div class="violet">
            <h3>VIOLET</h3>
            <p>In the RGB color model used in computer and television screens, violet is produced by mixing red and blue light, with more blue than red. In the RYB color model historically used by painters, violet is created with a combination of red and blue pigments and is located between blue and purple on the color wheel.
